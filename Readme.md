# PROJECT Remote glove [EN](README.md) [BG](README.bg.md)

![img_1.png](icon.png) \
Our project is a **GLOVE** that connects to the TV via Bluetooth and by moving it left and right imitates a remote. Channels and sound can be controlled via an infrared diode, and the mouse cursor can be moved if you are in an online application. All this only with slight movements of the hand. \
Our project is divided into 2 parts - a bluetooth receiver and a bluetooth transmitter. The receiver connects to the TV and is immediately recognized as a mouse. The transmitter, which is in the glove, then connects to the receiver. Control of the mouse cursor is done by sending signals from an accelerometer connected to the transmitter. \

### Why?
**The aim of our project is to develop a more functional and innovative TV remote control (glove)** and, above all, to make it easier for people watching YouTube or Netflix by providing an easy and convenient mechanism for controlling the mouse cursor. \
The current TV remotes have not changed much in the last 10 years. They provide a good method for managing the channels and basic functionalities of the TV, but with the advancement of technology, manufacturers make and sell "smart TV", which have access to the Internet and applications such as Internet browser, youtube, netflix. However, the navigation for these applications is still not well integrated and this is where our product comes in!

## Components and supplies:
- **C++** with **Arduino IDE** for code setup
- MPU 6050
- 2 x arduino micro
- bluetooth module HC-05 at master mode
- bluetooth module HC-06 at slave mode
- 2 x standard buttons
- 2 x 2k ohms resistors
