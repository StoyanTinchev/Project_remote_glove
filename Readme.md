# PROJECT Remote glove
![img.png](img.png) \
Our project is a **GLOVE** that connects to the TV via Bluetooth and by moving it left and right imitates a remote. Channels and sound can be controlled via an infrared diode and the mouse cursor can be moved if you are in an online application. All this only with slight movements of the hand. \
Our project is divided into 2 parts - a bluetooth receiver and a bluetooth transmitter. The receiver connects to the TV and is immediately recognized as a mouse. The transmitter, which is in the glove, then connects to the receiver. Control of the mouse cursor is done by sending signals from an accelerometer connected to the transmitter.
